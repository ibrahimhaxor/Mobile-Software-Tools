# How to unlock
To unlock please download the script on debian/ubuntu machine it will work on mac if you have python pip installed
- **SIM CARD** Will work if you did not restore device to factory settings if you did you can unlockit but sim card wont work :(
- if you restored device to factory settings skip step 1
# Step 1 
Launch the script and selcet ``Dump Sim card files from device`` this will dump files from the device so you can later activate the sim card
# Step 2 
Restore the device to factory settings this can be done via itunes or 3utools
make sure to not restore over ios 14 or ios 14 some ios 13 versions wont work so you might need to restore it few times via 3utools to unlock it!
# Step 3
Choose ``Automatic Icloud bypass`` and follow the steps
if iphone gets unlocked go to step 4
# Step 4 
In the same directory where you dumped files open the script again with command ``./start.sh``
Then select ``Dump Sim card files to device (WORKS IF YOU DID OPTION 5)``
# Step 5
Test out everything sim card may not work but you atleast tried.
