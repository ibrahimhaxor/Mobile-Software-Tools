It's really late and I have school tomorrow. I wanted to push this out as soon as I could so here it is for iOS 15.X. Not iOS 16 just yet...

Install tkinter, python3, sshpass, and whatever dependencies come with Sliver from appletech752.com

Instructions:
1. Connect iDevice
2. Open BlackRa1n folder and terminal on mac. 
3. In terminal enter the following command:
```
cd DRAG AND DROP BLACKRA1N FOLDER HERE
```
4. In terminal enter the following command:
```
python3 blackra1n.py
```
5. Pair iDevice in normal mode
6. Jailbreak iOS 15.X 
(Watch the terminal for information if anything fails or what happens. Follow DFU steps that will pop up.)
7. After your device is jailbroken and boots iOS you can continue to next step.
8. Put device into DFU mode.
8. Build Custom IPSW
9. Boot Custom IPSW (You did this step right if you see SSHRD, verbose mode, text on the screen)
10. Finally, Start BlackRa1n.
11. Device will reboot and you're done! 

If you get to recovery mode, just run Jailbreak step again and thats it device will boot bypassing iCloud Lock Activation.


I will update this asap. I have finals this week.
