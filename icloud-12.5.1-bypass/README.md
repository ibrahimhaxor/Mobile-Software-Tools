# iCloud Activation iOS 12.5.5 bypass (macOS)

Reliable iCloud Activation iOS 12.5.5 bypass working 100% of the time for macOS
(tested on two A7 iPhones 5s) (should work for any "late" iOS 12 (12.4+ I guess?
I tested it only on the last available iOS 12 version as there is no point in having older iOS 12 on A7 devices))

## Running the bypass script

1. Download [checkra1n](https://checkra.in).

2. Right click and run `bypass-first.command` file (or `bypass-second.command`
if your device was already bypassed and you just rebooted) and follow the instructions.

3. Enjoy your unlocked iDevice :) If you succeed please let me know
[opening an issue with your device model and iOS version](https://github.com/adrianjagielak/icloud-12.5.1-bypass/issues/new).
so I can add them to this Readme as tested. Thanks :)
