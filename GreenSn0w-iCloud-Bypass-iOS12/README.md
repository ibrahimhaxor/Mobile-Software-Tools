Make sure you have tkinter, sshpass, libmobiledevice and python3 installed! Look up yourself how to install those.

Steps to bypass iOS 12.0-12.5.6

Open Terminal and enter:
```
1. cd DRAG AND DROP GREENSN0W FOLDER HERE
```

```
2. python3 GUI.py
```

```
3. Put device into DFU mode. Click, Start checkra1n. This will jailbreak your device.
```
If your device just boots with Apple logo, try again until it boots verbose mode (text on screen)!
Repeat, DFU mode steps if it failed. Sometimes checkra1n doesn't succeed because it doesn't upload
the bootstrap files before jailbreaking. If you are having trouble, just put the device in normal
mode and click Start Checkra1n. Wait till in the terminal it says Uploading Bootstrap files, THEN
try putting the device into DFU mode and it should jailbreak. Try 3 more times. If it continues to
fail, please message me on twitter. @ios_euphoria

```
4. After a successful jailbreak, click Inject Payload. 
```
This will patch some of the necessary files of Setup App. Once a successful injection has been made, 
the device will shutdown. Boot device into DFU mode and run checkra1n again. Yes, you must run it 
again in order for the patch to work on the second step. When running the jailbreak again, remember,
you must see verbose mode booting on the device. You should see a message come up if this step worked
or failed. 

```
5. Run checkra1n again.
```

```
6. Run 'Make it Sn0w'. 
```
Device will respring with patched mobileactivationd thinking its Activated! After it resprings, you will be at home screen!

Enjoy <3
